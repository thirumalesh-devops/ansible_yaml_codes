- name: Demonstrate error handling in ansible using block...resucue.. always
#In playbooks, blocks are clauses that enclose tasks. 
#Blocks allow for logical grouping of tasks
#and can be used to control how tasks are executed.
#blocks in playbooks can be used with three keywords:
# block: Defines the main tasks to run.
# rescue: Defines the tasks that will be run if the tasks defined in the block clause fails.
# always: Defines the tasks that will always run independently of 
# the success or failure of tasks defined in the block and rescue clauses.
  hosts: localhost
  become: true
  tasks:
   - block:
     - name: Task to install a package
       yum:
        name: mariadb1
        state: installed
     rescue:
       - name: Print rescue message
         debug:
          msg: I am in rescue
     always:
       - name: print always block message
         debug:
          msg: I am in always

... #End of the play
